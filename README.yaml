  about: |
    Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies have
    enabled comprehensive cancer genomic testing by molecular
    pathologists across multiple tumor types. However, it is often
    challenging to assign the clinical and biological relevance of
    specific mutations observed in patients. While there is a
    multitude of databases that provide in silico assessment, there is
    no comprehensive database for annotating driver and passenger
    mutations.  Therefore, we created an expert-curated database of
    potentially actionable driver mutations for molecular pathologists
    and laboratory directors to facilitate literature-based annotation
    of genomic testing of tumors. We curated the chromosome location,
    all possible nucleotide positions, for each amino acid change and
    uploaded them to the CanDL database with associated literature
    reference.
